Welcome to the Udacity Feed Reader Test Project
===================

About
-------------

This project was done while attending the Front End Developer course at [Udacity](http://www.udacity.com).

In this project you can test a  [feed reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_aggregator), also known as a news aggregator.

#### How to use this project

 1. Clone or download this repository
 2. Open the index.html in any browser (IE10 or greater)
 3. At the top left side you can click to show/hide the menu and select your favorite feed
 4. At the bottom of the page you can see if the tests written are passing or or not ('*specs*' vs '*failures*')

#### Information

If you want you can add your own feeds by changing the  `allFeeds` variable in the `app.js` file.

#### Frameworks, APIs used and disclaimer

For this project I used the [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) JavaScript testing framework version 2.1.2.

The following articles served as reference:

 - [Jasmine documentation](http://jasmine.github.io/2.1/introduction.html)
 - [How do I Jasmine: a tutorial](https://evanhahn.com/how-do-i-jasmine/)
 - [Jasmine jQuery Testing](http://www.itsmycodeblog.com/jasmine-jquery-testing-css/)
 - [jQuery Documentation](http://api.jquery.com/)


As best as I could manage I did credits where credits are due. The Udacity forums served as a big information source, as well as Stackoverflow and numerous articles.
